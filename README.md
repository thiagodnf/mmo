A Free and Open Source Framework for Mono-Objective Optimization Problems

Available Metaheuristics
---
The framework has the following implemented metaheuristics:

- Random Search
- Hill Climbing
- Steepest Ascent Hill-Climbing
- Differential Evolution
- Genetic Algorithm (Working in progress)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (Working in progress)

Encoded Problems
---
To testing the metaheuristics, the following problems were encoded:

- One Max Problem
- Knapsack Problem
- Ackleys Function
- Two-dimensional Gaussian Function
- Michalewicz Function
- Rosenbrock Function

Operators
--
The framework has the following operators:

**Mutation**
- DE/Rand/1
- DE/Rand/2
- DE/Target-to-best/1

**Crossover**
- Single Point Crossover

Motivation
---
This frawework was developed during the course of Topics in Artificial Intelligence at Federal University of Parana, Brazil.
